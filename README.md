# Database Programming Laboratory

This repository contains lab assignments focused on database programming, covering topics from database management to dynamic web development using tools such as MySQL, PHP, C#, and more.

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 01: Introduction to Database Programming
This lab introduces the core concepts of database management systems and database programming. It covers essential components such as hardware, software, and procedures, along with basic SQL commands (DDL, DML). Additionally, the lab explores database architecture, laying the groundwork for more complex database interactions.

### Lab 02: C# & Windows Forms
Focuses on creating interactive user interfaces using Windows Forms in C#. This lab demonstrates the building of a basic desktop application, including form creation with controls like buttons and text fields, handling user events, and enhancing the user experience through design principles. Emphasis is placed on linking the UI to functional backend processes.

### Lab 03: Database Management with phpMyAdmin
This lab explores database management through the web-based phpMyAdmin tool, providing an intuitive interface to interact with MySQL databases. It covers tasks such as user management, database replication, running SQL queries, and configuring various database settings. By the end of the lab, the user gains hands-on experience managing databases without writing raw SQL commands.

### Lab 04: Database Management with MySQL
A deeper dive into MySQL, this lab focuses on hands-on management of databases using SQL commands. The topics include creating databases and tables, and performing key CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. In addition, it explores query execution and data manipulation within tables, providing a solid understanding of MySQL for practical applications.

### Lab 05: Data Manipulation using MySQL
This lab takes MySQL skills further by introducing advanced data manipulation techniques, such as using views, cursors, and advanced queries for complex database tasks. It also discusses database performance tuning, security considerations, and best practices for writing efficient SQL queries to handle large datasets and optimize operations.

### Lab 06: Database Programming using C# & MySQL
Focuses on integrating C# with MySQL to develop database-driven applications. The lab involves building a user interface in Windows Forms for a MySQL-connected application, performing CRUD operations, and enabling user interaction with the database through a graphical interface. This lab emphasizes backend integration, data processing, and maintaining data integrity.

### Lab 07: Static Website Development
Covers the process of developing a static website using HTML and CSS. The lab walks through the creation of well-structured HTML pages, applying CSS for styling, and understanding the role of each in web development. It provides hands-on practice in building responsive and visually appealing websites that form the foundation for dynamic web applications.

### Lab 08: Dynamic Website with PHP
This lab introduces the development of dynamic websites using PHP and HTML. It covers how to handle user input via forms, process that data using PHP scripts, and generate dynamic content based on user interactions. The focus is on connecting front-end forms with backend PHP logic, enabling real-time updates on web pages without reloading.

### Lab 09: Database Programming with PHP
Focuses on combining PHP with MySQL to perform database operations. The lab explains how to use PHP scripts to connect to a MySQL database and execute CRUD operations. It also covers file handling, error management, and the creation of dynamic web pages that interact with the database, enabling real-world web application development.

### Lab 11: Stored Procedures, Functions, & Triggers
Explores the use of stored procedures, functions, and triggers in MySQL to automate tasks and enhance database performance. This lab teaches how to create and manage custom procedures and functions, as well as implement triggers that automatically execute in response to specific database events. These tools help in optimizing workflows and maintaining data consistency.

### Lab 12: Database Security
This lab focuses on implementing comprehensive database security measures. It covers topics such as user management, setting privileges, and applying encryption techniques (MD5, SHA1) to secure sensitive data. Additionally, it discusses strategies for preventing SQL injection attacks and ensuring that database operations are conducted securely, protecting both data and users.
